# Wintrace
A small but useful python script to get information about any IP, heavily inspired by [Ip-Tracer](https://github.com/rajkumardusad/IP-Tracer).\
It uses [Ipify](https://www.ipify.org/) and [ip-api](https://ip-api.com/).\
Wintrace is also available online [here](https://just-a-mango.github.io/wintrace/)

## How to use Wintrace ?
`wintrace -m` to trace your own IP adress\
`wintrace ip` to trace a desired IP adress
