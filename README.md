# Wintrace
A small but useful python script to get information about any IP, heavily inspired by [Ip-Tracer](https://github.com/rajkumardusad/IP-Tracer).\
It uses [Ipify](https://www.ipify.org/) and [ip-api](https://ip-api.com/)

## How to use Wintrace ?
`python wintrace.py -m` to trace your own IP adress\
`python wintrace.py your_ip` to trace a desired IP adress
